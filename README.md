# strmr

A streaming media server with native mobile and TV apps. strmr supports:

- Usenet
- Real Debrid/Torbox

Scraping supports:

- Torrentio
- Newznab

## Backend Deployment

Deploy the backend using Docker Compose (or use the example in the repo):

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  strmr:
    image: godver3/strmr:latest
    container_name: strmr
    ports:
      - "7777:7777"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/cache:/root/cache
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The cache folder will contain user settings and stream metadata.

2. Start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:7777`. The backend logs will include a generated PIN to use to connect the frontend to the backend. You will need to add the PIN and your backend URL in the frontend app.

## Configuration

Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:7777/admin` to configure settings that are not available in the mobile/TV apps, including:

- Service credentials
- M3U link

Required settings are indicated in the web UI settings page.

## Roadmap

Current roadmap:

- cli_debrid style filtering
- Fine-grained ranking
- AIOstreams, Mediafusion, Jackett/Prowlarr support
- Non-M3U IPTV support
